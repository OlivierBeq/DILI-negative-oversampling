# Custom oversampling technique for negative samples.


This repository contains all the code that was used to obtain the results presented in [Keep looking at the negative side](). 

## Getting started

1. The data **required** to run the code contained in this repository is available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15091446).
Once downloaded, place the zipped *data* folder in the *src/DILI-negative-oversampling* folder.

2. Run the Python notebook in order **from 1 to 7** without skipping.

By default, files requiring substantial resources to be obtained are used as is.
To force them to be re-calculated, run notebook *XX-Advanced_removal_to_run_from_scratch*.

3. Figures and Tables will be either presented in the notebooks or saved in the folder *src/DILI-negative-oversampling/results*.
